      <h1 class="fn">Martin Rezk - PhD.</h1>
    </div>

    <p class="interest">I was born in Cordoba, Argentina in 1982. I lived there for 18 years.... same old
    story, seasons passed, things happened, some reading, no religion. Life. Then I
    started my studies in computer science at the Facultad de Astronomia, Matematica y
    Fisica (Universidad Nacional de Cordoba). During that time I also started to practice
    a contact karate style named Kyokushin. In 2007 I got my master degree, I won a
    national Kyokushin Torurnament, and I got my diver license. In 2008, I started my PhD
    studies in Bolzano, Italy and I dived with sharks in Australia... at night. The
    sharks decided not to eat me. I really appreciate that. In 2009-2010 I went to Stony
    Brook University (USA) to work with Michael Kifer, and I also started Brazilian Jiu
    Jitsu. I got 3rd place in the submission only Long Island Tournament. Last but not
    least, I have always enjoyed taking pictures, writing, climbing, and meeting fun
    people. I got my PhD on April 2012, and then I came to Korea. Nowadays I continue
    doing the same things: working, training, and jumping from place to place, maybe to
    escape, just like Qin Shi Huang and his 365 rooms.</p>
